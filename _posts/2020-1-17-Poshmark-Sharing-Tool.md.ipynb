    "## Introduction\n",
    "Poshmark is a social commerce marketplace where people in the United States can buy and sell new or used clothing, shoes, and accessories. Currently, I am an active user on Poshmark selling new fashion jewelry, women accessories and used personal clothing and shoes. Here is the [link](https://poshmark.com/closet/katie_ji) to my PM closet. Feel free to take a look!\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the nature of a social commerce marketplace, Poshmark requires sellers to interact with other users for exposure, meaning sharing and liking other users listings. I am introducing the following Python tool called Poshmark robot which automatically shares listings from any closet to party or followers.\n",

    "Please note that you may encounter a reCAPTCHA if you keep using this tool for a good amount of time (usually more than an hour). In such situation, you will need to manually check on the reCAPTCHA box before tool starts to work again."
